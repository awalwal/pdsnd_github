# Welcome to my Bikeshare project!

### Date created

### Bikeshare Project Overview
This Python project explores source data from Bikeshare rides and users in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. The data was provided by **Udacity** as part of an assignment in the _Introduction to Progamming for Data Science_ course.

This course is designed for newcomers to SQL, Python, Git, and GitHub. The project uses basic Python skills, with a few requirements that were more complicated for a novice like me!

### Description
When run in Anaconda, miniconda, or a similar platform, the Python file asks the user to select certain parameters in order to explore the data. This includes selecting the city (from the list provided), the month (or all months), and the day (or all days). 

Once the user has made these selections, the data is processed through a variety of filters to display interesting information, such as:
- Most Frequent Times of Travel
- Most Popular Stations and Trips
- Trip Duration
- Bikeshare User Demographics (where available)

At the end of this display, the user has the option to display raw data on the rides from the city data selected. Once they are done displaying the data they wish to see, they can opt to restart the program or to exit.
